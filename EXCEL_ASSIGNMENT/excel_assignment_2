 Q1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
 Ans = the dollar($) sign fixes the reference to a given cell, so that it remains unchanged no matter where the formula moves. Using dollar 
       in cell references allow us to copy the formula in excel without changing references.
       
Q2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
Ans =  Changing a cell from a relative to an absolute refence can b done by following steps:-
   
   I. open microsoft excel
   II. highlight the cell containing the formula we want to have changed to an absolute or relative reference.
   III. Click the formula box or highlight the formula and press the F4 key to switch between an absolute and relative cell reference.
   
  * Here is what happens when you select the reference and press the F4 key.

#. Press F4 key once: becomes ‘absolute’ from ‘relative’.
#. Press F4 key two times: changes to mixed reference where the row is locked.
#. Press F4 key three times: changes to mixed reference where the column is locked.


3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
Ans = Explain the order of operations in excel?
ans = In general, Excel's order of operation follows the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, 
Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) but with some customization to handle the formula syntax in a spreadsheet. 
Excel solves formulas in the following order:

#. Parentheses Reference operators
#. Exponents
#.Negation
#. Percent
#.Multiplication and Division
#.Addition and Subtraction
#. Concatenation
#.Logical operators

4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax
for any of two? 
Ans = top 5 and most used functions in excel are as follows:-

#. The SUM Function
The sum function is the most used function when it comes to computing data on Excel. 
This function works to sum a group of numbers in a specific set of cells.This function is performed by
typing the formula on the function bar and highlighting the cellsyou want summed before clicking “Enter”.
** The syntax formula for sum function is “=SUM” (number1, number2, etc.).

#. The TEXT Function
Text function is a useful tool that helps convert a date (or number) into a text string in a particular format. 
It falls in the category of string formulas that converts numerical values to a string. 
It is handy when users need to view numeric data in a readable format.
**The syntax formula for text function is “=TEXT” (value, format_text).

#. The VLOOKUP Function
VLookup is powerful Excel function that is often overlooked.
Users will find it useful when they need to find specific data on a large table. 
You can also use VLookup to search for names, phone number, or specific data on your sheet.

#. The AVERAGE Function
The average function is an extremely useful tool for getting the average value in a range of cells.
the average function works to find the “arithmetic mean” for a group of cells. 
Aside from the average function, Excel also has the median and mode function.

3. The CONCATENATE Function
This function is a good time saver when you need to combine data from 2 or more cells. 
Unlike the merge tool which physically merges two or more cells into a single cell, 
the concatenate function only combines the contents of the combined cells.


5. When would you use the subtotal function?
Ans = SUBTOTAL -> The SUBTOTAL Function in Excel allows users to create groups and then perform various other Excel functions 
such as SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, PRODUCT, MAX, etc. Thus, the SUBTOTAL function in Excel helps in analyzing the data provided.
Sometimes, we need data based on different categories. 
SUBTOTALS help us to get the totals of several columns of data broken down into various categories. 

6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
Ans=  syntax --> VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num,[range_lookup]) 

Here is the detailed explanation of arguments for Vlookup formula.

#. lookup_value : lookup_value is the first parameter of excel Vlookup formula . 
lookup_value is a required parameter in Vlookup function in excel . 
Lookup value is a value which user wants to search in the first column of a range array and wants 
the respective row values to be returned.

#.table_array: table_array is the second parameter of excel Vlookup formula. 
table_array is a required parameter in Vlookup function in excel. 
table_array is a range in Excel worksheet which user wants to search the lookup value in the first column of this table array.

#. col_index_num: col_index_num is the third parameter of excel Vlookup formula. 
col_index_num is a required parameter in Vlookup function in excel.
We need to mention column index number in the Vlookup formula to tell Excel from which column of the given array 
to be picked a row value of the lookup value. Column index number should be always greater 
than equals to 1 and less than or equals to number of columns in the given table array range. 

#. range lookup: range_lookup is the fourth parameter of excel formula. range_lookup is an optional parameter 
in Vlookup function in Excel. Range lookup parameter is to specify whether user required an exact match 
values or an approximate match values. If you omit this parameter, Vlookup function treat it as TRUE as default.
